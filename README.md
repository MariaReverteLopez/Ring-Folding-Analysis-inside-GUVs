# Ring-Folding-Analysis-inside-GUVs

MATLAB script to calculate the folding angle of an actin ring inside GUVs. To automatically detect both bundle ends as features and track their position over time, the Fiji plugin ‘TrackMate’ is employed to obtain end-points coordinates. Subsequently, the angles between the two bundle ends are calculated with the MATLAB script taking spot coordinates as vector with the vesicle’s centre point as origin.
